# Translator
A Dictionary data collection ADT class to solve the problem of translating English words into words of other languages.

## Objectives
### Part 1 

- implementing recursive and iterative methods for a Binary Search Tree (BST) data collection ADT class.
- using C++ exception handling mechanism.
- creating template classes.
- solving a problem going through the steps of the software development process.

### Part 2

#### Problem Statement

The problem can be generically described as follows: given a key (in this assignment, an English word), return its associated value (in this assignment, a word in another language). This type of problem is best solved using a Dictionary, i.e., a data collection that associates a value to a given key, just like a dictionary does in the real world. Indeed, we look up a word in a dictionary to find it value, i.e., information about the given word such as its definition, its origin, its pronunciation, etc.
